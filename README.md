A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:
1. Store the code
2. Track issues and changes
3. Enable you to collaborate with others

Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.

# using Git Commands and Managing GitHub Projects
Branches are the heart of workflows in Git-based version control systems like GitHub. 
Creating and using branches, and merging changes to the main branch with "Pull Requests". 
Git Commands: Working with GitHub repositories and automating workflows, using the web interface can be limiting and more time-consuming. 
Utilize various [Git commands] to clone and fork repositories, as well as commit, push and pull your changes using the command line : 

   - Various Git commands to clone and fork repositories
   - Commit
   - Push
   - Pull
   
-Explain how branches are used and describe pull requests.
-Describe the function of Git commands like push, pull, and fetch.
-Differentiate between cloning and forking GitHub projects.
-List the roles common in large projects.
-Create GitHub branches and perform merge operations using the GitHub Web interface.
-Execute Git commands to work with GitHub repositories from a terminal.
-Create a fork and clone of a GitHub repository, make code changes, and submit a pull request.
